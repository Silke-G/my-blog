        <p style="color: white;" id="blog">This blog was created as a capstone project within the scope of a Full-Stack Web Developer <br>
            course. It serves as both a learning experience and a showcase of the skills acquired throughout <br>
            the program. Built using modern web technologies like <span class="bold-text"> Node.js, Express, EJS, and Bootstrap</span>, <br>
            this platform demonstrates core concepts such as <span class="bold-text">dynamic content rendering, CRUD <br>
            operations, and responsive design</span>.<br>
            <br>

            The goal of this project was to build a fully functional blogging application where users can create, <br>
            edit, and delete posts while ensuring an intuitive user experience. This blog is a reflection of my <br>
            journey in web development, highlighting key aspects like backend logic, frontend design, and <br>
            database handling.<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the content as much as I enjoyed creating <br>
            this project!</p>
